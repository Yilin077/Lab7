Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed

Explanation:
Running automated tests within a GitHub Action on every push ensures that the code is continuously tested during development. This catches bugs early, prevents broken code from being merged into main branches, and helps maintain code quality and stability throughout the development cycle. It also helps teams work more confidently and collaboratively by automatically verifying each contribution before it's deployed or reviewed.

This approach supports Continuous Integration (CI), which is a standard practice in modern development workflows.
