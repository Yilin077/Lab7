1)Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed


Because running automated tests within a GitHub Action on every push ensures that the code is continuously tested during development. This catches bugs early, prevents broken code from being merged into main branches, and helps maintain code quality and stability throughout the development cycle. It also helps teams work more confidently and collaboratively by automatically verifying each contribution before it's deployed or reviewed.
2)No.End-to-end (E2E) tests are designed to simulate user interactions with the application and test the system as a whole. If you want to check whether a specific function returns the correct output, that is better done with unit tests
